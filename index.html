                 Intended to depict nerves or discomfort but 
                 commonly used to express a close call,
                  as if saying Whew! and wiping 
                  sweat from the forehead. </p>

             hidden meaning, or general positivity. Tone varies,

                  platforms.

                  form of the expression mind blown, 
                  it may represent such emotions as shock,
                 awe, amazement, and disbelief.</p>
